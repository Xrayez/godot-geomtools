		<member name="arc_tolerance" type="float" setter="set_arc_tolerance" getter="get_arc_tolerance" default="0.25">
			The maximum distance the flattened path will deviate from the mathematical representation of an arc. Smaller values will increase smoothness at a cost of performance. Only relevant when [member join_type] is set to [constant JOIN_ROUND].
		</member>
		<member name="end_type" type="int" setter="set_end_type" getter="get_end_type" enum="PolyOffsetParameters2D.EndType" default="3">
			See [code]END_*[/code] constants in [enum EndType].
		</member>
		<member name="join_type" type="int" setter="set_join_type" getter="get_join_type" enum="PolyOffsetParameters2D.JoinType" default="0">
			See [code]JOIN_*[/code] constants in [enum JoinType].
		</member>
		<member name="miter_limit" type="float" setter="set_miter_limit" getter="get_miter_limit" default="2.0">
			The maximum distance in multiples of [code]delta[/code] that vertices can be offset from their original positions before squaring is applied. The default value is 2.0 (twice delta) which is the smallest value that's allowed to avoid generating unacceptably long 'spikes' at very acute angles.
		</member>

	<constants>
		<constant name="JOIN_SQUARE" value="0" enum="JoinType">
			Squaring is applied uniformly at all convex edge joins at [code]1 * delta[/code].
		</constant>
		<constant name="JOIN_ROUND" value="1" enum="JoinType">
			While flattened paths can never perfectly trace an arc, they are approximated by a series of arc chords.
		</constant>
		<constant name="JOIN_MITER" value="2" enum="JoinType">
			There's a necessary limit to mitered joins since offsetting edges that join at very acute angles will produce excessively long and narrow "spikes". For any given edge join, when miter offsetting would exceed that maximum distance, "square" joining is applied.
		</constant>
		<constant name="END_POLYGON" value="0" enum="EndType">
			Endpoints are joined using one of the [code]JOIN_*[/code] values and the path filled as a polygon.
		</constant>
		<constant name="END_JOINED" value="1" enum="EndType">
			Endpoints are joined using one of the [code]JOIN_*[/code] values and the path filled as a polyline.
		</constant>
		<constant name="END_BUTT" value="2" enum="EndType">
			Endpoints are squared off with no extension.
		</constant>
		<constant name="END_SQUARE" value="3" enum="EndType">
			Endpoints are squared off and extended by [code]delta[/code] units.
		</constant>
		<constant name="END_ROUND" value="4" enum="EndType">
			Endpoints are rounded off and extended by [code]delta[/code] units.
